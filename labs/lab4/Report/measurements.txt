Measure:

Series resistance (ohms) 2.6
speed constant (rpm/V) 350
torque constant (Nm/A) .0271

Calculate:
Maximum torque at 24V .25 Nm
Maximum power at 24V 55.38 W

How well are the datasheet specs met?

What is the maximum current the motor can draw from the power supply?

To safely bring a motor to top speed, as fast as possible, what would you do?

Find the load inertia by applying a large voltage step (0-20V) and capture the current waveform from stopped to steady state. (don't hit power supply max)

Measure inductance at pwm frequency 

Measure inductance at several slower frequencies 

Why can't you measure resistance this way?
